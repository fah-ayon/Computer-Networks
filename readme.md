# CSE 421: Computer Networks

Welcome to the CSE 421: Computer Networks repository! This repository is designed to assist students in understanding the fundamental concepts of computer networks, as covered in the course. It includes resources like lab assignments, theory assignments, notes, and previous semester questions to support your learning journey.

## Course Description
CSE 421 introduces students to the basics of transport connections, session protocols, and end-to-end data networks. Topics covered include:

- Transport and session layer protocols
- End-to-end protocols and message handling
- TCP/IP protocols and congestion control
- Wireless networks, mobile computing, and high-speed networks
- Data link layer, error control, and media access
- Distributed computation, file systems, and network management
- Fault tolerance, network security, and privacy
- Algorithm for deadlock detection, synchronization, and concurrency control
- OSI Model and protocol hierarchy

The course includes a compulsory 3-hour laboratory work each week (if the student wishes to obtain CCNA certification) or a compulsory 3-hour lab work every alternate week. **Pre-requisite**: CSE 320.
